    \item[Abstract] This article presents a technique for the accurate assessment of the spatially averaged incident power density (IPD) on a spherical human head model from 3.5 to 100 GHz.
    The spatially-averaged IPD is defined either by averaging components of the power density vector normal to an evaluation surface, or by averaging its norm.
    The electromagnetic exposure assessment is provided for a dipole antenna placed at a separation distance of 2--150 mm from the model.
    We compare the IPD averaged over a proposed spherical surface with differently positioned planar surfaces.
    Results show that, for appropriate settings of the exposure above 6 GHz, the IPD averaged on a spherical surface is up to 12\% larger for the normal definition, while marginally lower for the norm definition.
    In the worst case scenario, the spatially averaged IPD on a spherical surface is up to about 30\% larger regardless of the definition.
    Comparative analysis between the definitions of the IPD averaged on a spherical model demonstrates that the norm definition yields significantly larger values in the reactive near field at characteristic frequencies, whereby this difference is marginal out of the reactive near field.
